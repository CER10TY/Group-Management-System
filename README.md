# Group Management System

This is a dump of an (incomplete) work assignment I did over half a year ago. The Group Management System (GMS for short,
as referenced in namespace) handles the back-end of a school management system, where one can assign Students to individual
Groups, Classes as well as Grades. Almost everything is intertwined in one way or another, however the flowchart
present in the main folder explains everything relatively well. 

Quite a few found and unfound issues remain, and as a 48h time limit was placed on this, this is not a finished version.
